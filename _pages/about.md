My name is Olawale (Wale) Salaudeen, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by <a href="http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Sanmi Koyejo.</a> Prior to Illinois, I received a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Texas A&M University.

# Research Interests
---
I am broadly interested machine learning, causality, and the intersection between the two. My work focuses on robustness in machine learning using principles from causality. In addition, I am interested in applications to neuroscience/neuroimaging, healthcare, and fairness.
