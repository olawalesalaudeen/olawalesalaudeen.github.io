My name is Olawale (Wale) E. Salaudeen, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science
at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, advised by 
<a href="http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/">Sanmi Koyejo.</a> 
Prior to moving to Illinois, I
received a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and minors in
Computer Science and Mathematics from the Texas A&M University.

# Research Interests
---
I am broadly interested machine learning in general and causal
inference/discovery. In particular, I work on domain adaptation/generalization and causal
structure learning (under measurement error). 
Additionally, I am interested in applications to neuroscience, healthcare, and fairness.
