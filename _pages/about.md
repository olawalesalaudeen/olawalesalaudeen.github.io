My name is Olawale (Wale) Salaudeen, and I am an postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL</a> in the <a href="https://healthyml.org" target="_blank">Healthy ML Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/" target="_blank">Professor Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>. Prior to my postdoc, I earned a PhD in Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> and the  <a href="https://stairlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> Stanford Trustworthy AI Research (STAIR) Lab </a> at <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>, advised by <a href="http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Sanmi Koyejo.</a> I am honored to have received a Sloan Scholarship, Beckman Graduate Research Fellowship, GEM Associate Fellowship, and an NSF Miniature Brain Machinery Traineeship.  Additionally, I am fortunate to have interned at Sandia National Laboratories, Google Brain, Cruise LLC, and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.

Before Illinois, I received a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/index.html" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>.
# Research Interests
---
I am broadly interested in reliable and trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to improve the robustness of machine learning models for real-world decision-making. Particularly, I aim to develop the principles and practices of robust generalization, adaptation, and evaluation in machine learning. Additionally, I am interested in diverse applications, including neuroscience/neuroimaging, healthcare, and algorithmic fairness. My experience and interests span generative AI, statistical machine learning, multi-modal deep learning, domain adaptation/generalization, causality-inspired machine learning, and probabilistic graphical models.
